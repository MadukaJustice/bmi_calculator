# A BMI calculator
### I developed this project in order to increase my understanding of the usage of react hooks in software development

## Overview
#### Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

A high BMI can be a sign of too much fat on the body, while a low BMI can be a sign of too little fat on the body. The higher a person’s BMI, the greater their chances of developing certain serious conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. A very low BMI can also cause health problems, including bone loss, decreased immune function, and anemia.

While BMI can be useful in screening children and adults for body weight problems, it does have its limits. BMI may overestimate the amount of body fat in athletes and other people with very muscular bodies. It may also underestimate the amount of body fat in older adults and other people who have lost muscle mass.

### Body Mass Index Formula
#### BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight by the square of their height.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a simple online child and teen BMI calculator for ages 2 to 19, and an adult BMI calculatorTrusted Source for ages 20 and older.

To calculate the BMI, you enter the height in feet and weight in pounds. BMI is calculated the same way for people of all ages. However, BMI is interpreted differently for adults and children.

### Body Mass Index for Adults
#### Adults age 20 and older can interpret their BMI based on the following standard weight status categories. These are the same for men and women of all ages and body types:

BMI	Weight Status
* Below 18.5	Underweight
* 18.5 – 24.9	Normal
* 25.0 – 29.9	Overweight
* 30.0 and above	Obese
